* TVL (Total Value Locked): Get insights into the total value locked in a token's associated smart contract or protocol.

### Wallet Lookup

With this function, users can easily check the amount of tokens held by any AdaHandle or Stake Key. Simply provide the AdaHandle or the Stake Key, and the bot will retrieve the following information:

* Amount of Tokens Held: Discover how many tokens are associated with the provided AdaHandle or Stake Key.
* Valuation of Tokens Held in ADA: Get an estimation of the value of the tokens held in ADA based on the current token price.

We're continuously working on enhancing the functionality of the ChainSmith Bot, and we also offer other Discord bot services. â˜• If you're interested in sponsoring our work or have any questions, please feel free to contact us!
